Introduction
============

The semi-analyitcal line transfer (SALT) model is a semi-analytical radiation transfer model designed to predict the spectra of galactic outflows.  This documentation shows how to install and compute SALT.  Examples of different line profile predictions are provided.  In addition, we provide a detailed example showcasing how to fit SALT to a real spectrum.

About the Model
***************

The SALT model was first introduced by Scarlata and Panagia (2015), but has since been modified by Carr et al. (2018,2023).  The 
following documentation is based on the formalism presented in Carr et al. (2023).  While we refer the reader to this paper for 
the details regarding the calculation of the radiation transfer, we provide a physical description of the model and its parameter space here.  All projects which use the SALT model should cite the Carr et al. (2023) paper.

The basic model assumes a spherical source of isotropically emitted radiation which propogates through an expanding medium (i.e., an outflow).  The outflow is characterized by a density field, :math:`n(r)=n_0(\frac{r}{R_{SF}})^{-\delta}`, and velocity field, :math:`v(r)=v_0(\frac{r}{R_{SF}})^{\gamma}`.  The geometry of the outflow is that of a bicone described by an opening angle, :math:`\alpha`, and orientation angle, :math:`\psi`, which can open all the way into a sphere.  A picture of the general model is provided in Figure 1.  In addition, the outflow is assumed to be embedded in a spherical envelope of dust with density which scales with the density of the outflow (see Carr et al. 2021 for a description).  The observational effects of a limiting observing aperture is also considered.

   The model consists of a biconical outflow of opening angle, :math:`\alpha`, and orientation angle, :math:`\psi`, which extends from the surface of the star forming region at radius, :math:`R_{SF}`, to a terminal radius, :math:`R_{W}`.

The SALT model represents a solution to the radiation transfer of resonant photons through the outflow.  In addition, SALT can handle fluorescent emission following resonant scattering (see Scarlata and Panagia 2015 for details).  The next section shows how to compute SALT given various line profiles.  Examples include lines with and without fluorescence.

Using the Model
===============

The SALT model code consists of three python scripts: SALT2022_Absorption.py, SALT2022_Emission.py, and SALT2022_LineProfile.py.  All three scripts can be obtained from GitHub by entering the following command in a terminal window  git clone git@github.com:CodyCarr/SALT.git.  The model can also be accessed by downloading the three scripts from the following documentation.  Working from within the SALT folder, one can run SALT with Python using the following script.  

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    from SALT2022_LineProfile import Line_Profile
