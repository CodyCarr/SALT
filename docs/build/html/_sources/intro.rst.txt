Introduction
============

The semi-analyitcal line transfer (SALT) model is a semi-analytical 
radiation transfer model to predict the spectra of galactic outflows.  
This documentation shows how to install and compute spectra for arbitrary 
line profiles with SALT.  

About the Model
***************

SALT assumes a biconical outflow of expanding material.
